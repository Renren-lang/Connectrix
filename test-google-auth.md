# Google Authentication Test Guide

## 🚀 Local Development Server Status
✅ **Server is running on http://localhost:3000**

## 🧪 Test Steps for Google Authentication

### 1. **Open the Application**
- Navigate to: http://localhost:3000
- You should see the landing page

### 2. **Go to Login Page**
- Click "Login" or navigate to: http://localhost:3000/login
- You should see the login form with Google sign-in button

### 3. **Test Google Authentication**
- Click "Sign in with Google" button
- **Expected behavior:**
  - Popup should open with Google account selection
  - Select your account and role (student/alumni)
  - **Should go directly to dashboard** - no second account selection
  - No loading loops or repeated account selection

### 4. **Check Console Logs**
- Open browser console (F12 → Console tab)
- Look for these success messages:
  - `🔧 Starting Google authentication with provider`
  - `🔧 Popup completed successfully`
  - `✅ Google popup authentication successful`
  - `🚀 Redirecting to dashboard for role: [role]`

### 5. **Test Different Scenarios**
- **Test with different Google accounts**
- **Test with popup blocked** (disable popups temporarily)
- **Test with different roles** (student vs alumni)

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ **Success Indicators:**
- Single account selection (no double selection)
- Direct redirect to appropriate dashboard
- Console shows successful authentication flow
- No error messages in console

### ❌ **Problem Indicators:**
- Multiple account selection prompts
- Loading loops or hanging
- Console errors
- Redirect back to login page

## 🐛 Debugging

If you encounter issues:
1. **Check console logs** for error messages
2. **Clear browser cache** and try again
3. **Check if popups are allowed** for localhost:3000
4. **Try incognito mode** to rule out extension conflicts

## 📱 Test on Different Devices
- **Same PC, different browser**
- **Different PC/device**
- **Mobile device** (if accessible)

**Note:** The localhost version should work exactly like the production version after our fixes.
